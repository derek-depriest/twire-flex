Twire Flex is an enhanced fork of [Twire](https://github.com/twireapp/Twire) with **Flex Mode support** for foldable devices like the Samsung Galaxy Fold series.

## What's New in Twire Flex

### 🔄 Flex Mode Support
Optimized layout for foldable devices in "tabletop mode" (half-folded with horizontal hinge):
- **Video on top half** - Perfect viewing angle when device is propped up
- **Chat on bottom half** - Interactive chat easily accessible
- **Automatic detection** - Seamlessly switches when you fold/unfold
- **Smooth animations** - Polished transitions between modes
- **Toggle in settings** - Enable/disable flex mode as needed
- **Additional Themes** - I highly recommend Twitch OLED

Perfect for hands-free Twitch viewing on foldable devices!
